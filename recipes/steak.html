    <h1>The BEST Pan-Seared Steak</h1>

    <p>This 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven). This is one of our favorite steak recipes and we make it year-round because it’s such a quick and convenient cooking method. That garlic butter is lip-smacking good! Read on for great tips on how to improve beef sustainability, reduce food waste and you will love our ideas for easy meal prep with leftover steak.</p>
    
    <p>It really doesn’t get any easier than this and you don’t need much to make a lip-smacking good steak. We used 2 New York Strip Steaks, each weighing 1 pound and 1 1/4″ thick. Keep in mind a thicker steak will take longer to cook through and a thinner steak will cook faster.</p>

<h2>How to Pan Sear Steaks:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Pat dry0 – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
    <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
    <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
    <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
    <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pro Tip: We prefer using a large cast-iron pan for best heat conduction, but a large heavy stainless steel pan will also work.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for the Best Steak:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Preheat pan 5 minutes before adding steak for a great sear with good color and flavor.</li>
    <li>Press steak down just as it hits the pan to ensure steak makes contact with the surface of the pan.</li>
    <li>Loosely cover and rest steaks on a cutting board 10 minutes before slicing so they don’t dry out.</li>
    <li>Don’t slice too thin, or the steak cools too quickly.</li>
    <li>Slice steak against the grain and at an angle for a steakhouse presentation</li>    
</ul>
