    <h1>Crisp Sautéed Red Potatoes</h1>
    <p>I love new baby red potatoes. They’re simple to prepare and you don’t need much to make them delicious. You don’t even need to bother with peeling the skin. Actually the thin skins are delicious; crisp with a sprinkling of course salt. Mmmm.</p>

<p>My husband and son couldn’t wait to eat them so I let my boys grab forks and enjoy these straight out of the pan with some good quality ketchup. They make a great side dish to beef, chicken, or any kind of meat, really. I hope you love these taters!</p>

<h2>Ingredients for Pan Fried Baby Red Potatoes:</h2>
<ul>
   <li>1 1/2 lbs small red potatoes (cut in half or quartered to make 3/4-inch thick pieces)</li> 
   <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
   <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
   <li>Salt (preferably kosher or sea salt), to taste</li>
   <li>Black pepper (freshly ground), to taste</li>
   <li>2 Tbsp chives or green onion, chopped, plus more to garnish</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Make Sautéed Red Potatoes:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp butter and 2 Tbsp olive oil. Once butter is melted and hot, arrange potatoes in the skillet, cut-side-down in one layer. Cook uncovered and undisturbed 8-10 minutes or until golden brown crust forms on the bottoms.</li>
    <li>Turn potatoes then cover and cook another 5 minutes or until golden brown on the second side, you’ll hear it spit and splatter under the lid; just be careful when you first lift of the lid as juices from the lid can dribble into the pan and splatter.

        Keep the wee ones away from the stove. In hind sight, a dutch oven with taller walls might have been a better choice to cook these.</li>
    <li>Turn the potatoes again, cover and cook another 5 minutes or until you can easily pierce potatoes with a knife. Remove from heat and sprinkle with salt (I used about 3/4 tsp salt) & pepper (I used about 1/8 tsp pepper) toss with 2 Tbsp chives. Sprinkle with more fresh chives just before serving and enjoy.</li>
