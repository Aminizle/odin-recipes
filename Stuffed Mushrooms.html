    <h1>Smoked Gouda and Bacon Stuffed Mushrooms</h1>

    <p>These are the stuffed mushrooms I teased you with back in November (Thanksgiving dinner). This is my sister Svetlana’s recipe and it’s quite scrumptious!</p>

    <p>These mushrooms are stuffed with a mix of cheeses, bacon and onion and are baked to perfection. I really should stop posting recipes at night; it always makes me hungry. Imagine that.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Stuffed Mushrooms:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb white or brown mushrooms</li>
        <li>6-8 oz bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small/medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>Don’t slice too thin, or the steak cools too quickly.</li>
        <li>2 cups (1/3 lb) smoked gouda cheese, finely grated</li>    
        <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese, finely grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Cheese Stuffed Mushrooms:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the Oven to 400˚F. Wipe the mushrooms with a barely damp paper towel. DO NOT WASH MUSHROOMS!</li>
    <li>Remove the stems from mushrooms and scrape out the centers with either a melon baller or a measuring teaspoon.</li>
    <li>Mix the two cheeses together. Set 1/4 of the cheese aside</li>
    <li>Saute chopped bacon with chopped onion 5-7 minutes on medium high heat until bacon is cooked through and browned. (don’t add any oil, the bacon has plenty). Stir frequently so you don’t burn your onions. Transfer the bacon and onion mix to a bowl (get rid of the excess oil in the pan).</li>
    <li>Once the bacon is cooled to room temperature, mix it into the larger portion of cheese</li>
    <li>Place a heaping tablespoon into each mushroom so it’s plump and full. Top each mushroom with with extra cheese</li>
    <li>Bake at 400˚F for 8 minutes or until they are soft to the squeeze and just starting to look a little juicy. Don’t overcook them or they will get soggy.</li>
</ol>
